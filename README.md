# Code-Refactor

## Description 

Refactor the code to make with more accessible while maintaining the full functionality of the website. These edits were made to make the website optimized for search engines. This was accomplished by creating a well the HTML elements in logical structure and adding comments at each section. Adding alt attributes to the images with a description will enhance the accessibility of the website. Consolidating the CSS stylesheet and making sure the code followed the HTML semantic structure makes future edits to certain parts to be located quickly. Reducing the amount of repetitive code in the CSS file will help the ability for future web developer to contribute to this project. One of the challenges that I faced during this project was identifying what the best way was to consolidate the CSS file. Identifying the repetitive section was one of the major aspects I looked for to solve this issue. In the future I hope I can add additional HTML documents and pages to this website to give the customer more useful information.
